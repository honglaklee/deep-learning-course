    "# Reinforcement Learning Basics Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is adapted from [python tutorial](https://medium.com/@m.alzantot/deep-reinforcement-learning-demysitifed-episode-2-policy-iteration-value-iteration-and-q-978f9e89ddaa), which shows how to implement value iteration and tabular Q learning\n",
    "on the FrozenLake task from the `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "In `FrozenLake-v0`, the agent controls the movement of a character in a grid world. Some tiles of the grid are walkable, and others lead to the agent falling into the water. Additionally, the movement direction of the agent is uncertain and only partially depends on the chosen direction. The agent is rewarded for finding a walkable path to a goal tile. \n",

    "![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*MCjDzR-wfMMkS0rPqXSmKw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this task, the episode ends when you reach the goal or fall in a hole. You receive a reward of 1 if you reach the goal, and zero otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deterministic Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic environment means that both state transition model and reward model are deterministic functions. If the agent while in a given state repeats a given action, it will always go the same next state and receive the same reward value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stochastic Environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a stochastic environment there is uncertainty about the actions effect. When the agent repeats doing the same action in a given state, the new state and received reward may not be the same each time. For example, a robot which tries to move forward but because of the imperfection in the robot operation or other factors in the environment (e.g. slippery floor), sometimes the action forward will make it move forward but in sometimes, it will move to left or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment `FrozenLake-v0` from OpenAI Gym is a stochastic environment. FrozenLake-v0 is considered \"solved\" when the agent obtains an average reward of at least 0.78 over 100 consecutive episodes. We can also make a deterministic version of the environment."
